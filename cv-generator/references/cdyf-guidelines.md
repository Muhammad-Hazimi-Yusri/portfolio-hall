Source: cdyf.me by Duncan Hull

## Seven Point Check

1. **Education** - Year, degree, university, classification clear? Reverse chronological?
2. **Structure** - ~5 headings, most important first?
3. **Numbers** - Quantified with specifics, not "many" or "large"?
4. **Verbs first** - Every bullet starts with action verb?
5. **Style** - Good template, easy on eye, no typos?
6. **Length** - Exactly one page (résumé) or two (CV)?
7. **Tailored** - Customised to job description?

## C.A.R.E. Framework

Every entry should show:
- **Context** - Where, when, team size, scope
- **Action** - What YOU specifically did
- **Result** - Measurable outcome
- **Evidence** - Can be verified

## Writing Rules

### Do
- Start every bullet with past-tense action verb
- Use specific numbers: "team of 5", "30% to 85%", "50+ topics"
- Keep past tense consistent throughout
- Distinguish paid (Experience) vs unpaid (Projects)
- Put Technical Skills at the end
- Use reverse chronological order everywhere

### Don't
- Use pronouns (I, me, my, we, our)
- Use vague words (many, various, multiple, several, large, big, small)
- Use passive voice ("was developed" → "Developed")
- Include opinions ("excellent communicator")
- Mix tenses
- Add irrelevant info

## Strong Verbs by Category

**Technical:** Developed, Implemented, Designed, Built, Created, Integrated, Optimised, Automated, Deployed, Configured, Tested, Refactored

**Leadership:** Led, Coordinated, Managed, Mentored, Facilitated, Collaborated

**Analysis:** Analysed, Evaluated, Researched, Investigated, Measured

**Achievement:** Achieved, Improved, Increased, Reduced, Delivered, Completed, Launched

## Structure (One-Page Résumé)

Recommended ~5 sections:
1. Education
2. Experience (paid work)
3. Projects (unpaid/personal)
4. Hackathons/Awards (if relevant)
5. Technical Skills (at end)

## Formatting

- Dates consistently aligned (right side)
- No random font changes
- No ugly underlining
- Adequate whitespace - not cramped or gappy
- No single words taking whole line (rephrase to fit)
